Project C: AI In Action
Description: An interactive sentiment analysis dashboard powered by AI helps organizations quickly understand emotions hidden in text data. It collects inputs such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey feedback, then uses natural language processing to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The results are displayed through clear charts, word clouds, and trend lines, allowing users to filter by time, topic, or audience. Real-time monitoring and alerts highlight sudden shifts in sentiment, while comparisons across regions or products reveal deeper insights. This makes complex text data easy to interpret, enabling faster decisions, stronger customer experiences, and better brand management.
